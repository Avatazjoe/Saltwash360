## How to get started

First, [install React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/docs/setup.html) and create a default project.

Next, drop the Saltwash360 files into the default project:
* replacing the default client.js and index.js files
* adding the truck.js file
* adding the static_assets (360WorldSun.jpg, Horn.wav, Moon.png, SkullAndBones.png, Sun.png, Truck.mtl, Truck.obj)

And that's it! Run the project in a browser - you can pan around the virtual world with a mouse. 

Firefox browser lets you view the project using a VR headset - granting you stereo vision, 6DoF and 3D audio!
